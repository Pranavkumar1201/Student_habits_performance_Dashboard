Exam Scores

I gone through this data and understood the trends and made a notes to extract what I can.
I applied my skills like Data Cleaning and processing. And I have done all these using "Power BI". 
I used the features like Power Query Editor, Conditional Formatting, DAX, etc., 
I done the Data Visualization in comparing with every columns with Exam Scores and how they helped students in their Education.

Insights :-
1.More Exercise Frequency made the students to perform better in their Exams
2.People with less mental_health_rating have performed bad in the exam.
3.Students with even high netflix_hours and high socail_media_hours have also scored the best scores.
4.Also students having average Attendance_percentage also score an average of 85%.
5.Students with best Sleep_hours have score more 100's than the other students. On an average student with min. 5.5 to 8 hours scored the best.
