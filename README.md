I got the dataset from an opensoure website called "Kaggle".
This data set contains of :-
Study Hours
Social Media & Netflix Usage
Part-Time Jobs & Attendance

Exercise Frequency

Exam Scores

I gone through this data and understood the trends and made a notes to extract what I can.
I applied my skills like Data Cleaning and processing. And I have done all these using "Power BI". 
I used the features like Power Query Editor, Conditional Formatting, DAX, etc., 
I done the Data Visualization in comparing with every columns with Exam Scores and how they helped students in their Education.
